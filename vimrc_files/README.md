vimrc files
============
These are files for configuring the awesome text editor `vim`. To use these files, rename them to `.vimrc` and place them in your home directory.


Note: Some of these `.vimrc` files may require you to already have [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) installed, if you don't want to have to install pathogen, comment out the line that has `execute pathogen#infect()`.
