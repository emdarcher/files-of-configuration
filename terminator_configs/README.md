terminator configs
==================
Configuration files for the `terminator` terminal emulator on linux. These config files can be used by renaming them to just `config`, and putting them in `~/.config/terminator` (`~` standing for your home directory of course) on a Debian/Ubuntu-based Linux distro (this folder structure may be the same on other distros, but I haven't checked).
